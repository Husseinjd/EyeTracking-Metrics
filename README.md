# EyeTracking Metrics Calculator



## Overview
The project contains methods to calculate some of the known metrics used in eye tracking research
including:

1) Spatial Spatial (Goldberg, H. J., & Kotval, X. P. (1999))
2) ConvexHull
3) Nearest Neighbor Index (Di Nocera et al., 2006)


A Juypter notebook to illustrate the usage with a dummy example.


## Testing

A test module is included to test the metric methods used.
More can be added and tested

to run the test:

```
pip install pytest
py.test test_metric_calculation.py
```

## Additional Notes

More metrics will be added
